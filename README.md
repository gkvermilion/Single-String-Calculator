# Calculator
The simple calculator on Python was made w/ my changes... Please check and comment what you think of it!!!:3
Okay, so, the main thing is that all calculators for beginners have type like:
  a = int(input())
  b = int(input())
  operation = input()
  
so I thought how's about to make a calculator on Python that will work with string record like that:
  Input in console: 2+2
  Output: 2 + 2 = 4
  
So after one hour of brainstorming I finally made it.
This is my 1st project on GitHub so i would be grateful for any criticism, help and advice from members of the community
